All Lords&amp;Knights bot stuff merged together
When I was playing https://lordsandknights.com Lords and Knights mobile online game I had a "library" to make bots.
It included Alliance Help Auto Clicker which could use up to 10 accounts(that many fitted into GUI, could be more) and
could recover from server errors; advanced attack planner which was analysing players from rating, around points on a map, 
could sort targets by fortress or city clusters; spam-bot which could message thousands of top players using several
accounts simultaneously etc. Also there was a stupid farm-bot which could upgrade buildings but I never had a time to make it
work good.
I dont play anymore but maybe someone will find it useful one day. Or maybe even I will. God forbid... That game take so much
time:( ...
